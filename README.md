# Ing. Juan Sebastian Barreto Jimenez

## Profile
System Engineer and Electronic Engineer with 1 Year of Experience specializing in Kotlin Multiplatform app development, financial Android applications, and embedded systems. Led a team in creating a cutting-edge mobile app for IOS and Android, managed projects in Django Python, implemented GraphQL, and leveraged MongoDB. Contributed to the development of afinancial Android application, engaged in ongoing maintenance, and operated within a Scrum framework. Led architecture co-design for HW and SW on FPGA DE1-SOC with an embedded ARM Cortex A9, published work on the implementation of a deep learning library in C for resource-constrained embedded platforms. Additionally, worked on side projects including a mental health support app, a smart shelf system, and a residential complex application.

### Brief Description
The edge computing paradigm enables on-site data processing, but it requires robust computers for resource-intensive algorithms like deep learning. This project aims to develop a deep learning library for edge computing. It includes popular layers from RNN and CNN architectures. Tests are conducted on both a computer and four embedded platforms to verify the library's design and assess platform suitability for classifying four models. The study also considers model size and computational resources for scalability analysis.
