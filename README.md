## Systems engineering Degree Work - July 2022 to July 2023
Explore my degree project, where I've implemented a deep learning library in the C programming language tailored for embedded platforms with limited computational resources.

- **Full Project:** [EmbeddedAI Organization](https://gitlab.com/EmbeddedAI)
- **Library Repository:** [Library for Deep Learning in Embedded Systems](https://gitlab.com/EmbeddedAI/library-for-deep-learning-in-embedded-systems)

### Brief Description
The edge computing paradigm enables on-site data processing, but it requires robust computers for resource-intensive algorithms like deep learning. This project aims to develop a deep learning library for edge computing. It includes popular layers from RNN and CNN architectures. Tests are conducted on both a computer and four embedded platforms to verify the library's design and assess platform suitability for classifying four models. The study also considers model size and computational resources for scalability analysis.

## Electronic Engineering Degree Work - July 2021 to July 2022
Explore my degree project, where I've implemented a System on a Chip with codesign to execute a LeNet of Digit Recognition on DE1-SoC with part of Hardware on FPGA and part of Software on ARM Cortex A9.

- **Full Project:** [EmbeddedLeNet Organization](https://gitlab.com/EmbeddedAI/embedded-lenet)
- **Hardware Repository:** [Implementation SoC - HW](https://gitlab.com/EmbeddedAI/embedded-lenet/soc-hw-digit-detection-lenet)
- **SOftware Repository:** [Implementation SoC - SW](https://gitlab.com/EmbeddedAI/embedded-lenet/Digit-detection-LeNet)

### Brief Description
This project implements a System on a Chip (SoC) with co-design principles to execute LeNet for Digit Recognition on the DE1-SoC platform. The objective is to optimize computational costs for AI applications on medium and small-sized platforms by combining FPGA for hardware acceleration and ARM Cortex A9 for software processing. Focusing on the efficient LeNet model, the study explores its performance on diverse platforms, providing insights into the feasibility of embedding neural networks in FPGA-based systems. The project contributes valuable knowledge on limitations, recommendations, and best practices in designing and deploying AI models.
